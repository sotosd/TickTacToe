Implementation of the TickTacToe Game in Java

Imlementation of Server and Client (TickTacToe)

After importing both project Files (Server and TickTackToe), first run Server project file . Then run TickTacToe project file in order to create a client. (You can run multiple times for more clients-2 are enough to test it)

Enter names for each player.
You have 3 choises: 
-Create a game
-Enter random game (as long as it exists)
-Enter  a specific Game (in which you have to enter your opponent's name)

When the game is done, you can either play again or quit (Log Off)


*Note:
The project has few bugs which need to be fixed (like logging off which is not working in some occasions)
